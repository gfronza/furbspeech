==========

FurbSpeech is a Java-based API that converts portuguese text into speech. It uses the MBrola System in the back-end to provide the convertion from phonetic notation to media file (WAV format). FurbSpeech was fully developed in Java language, considering that MBrola system is a native executable. It means that the portability is directly dependent of the platforms supported by MBrola.
